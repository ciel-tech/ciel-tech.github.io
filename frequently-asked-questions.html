     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5192"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5195-4"><!-- content --><p>Why choose us?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5193"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5194-10"><!-- content --><p>We have been in the Data Recovery business for over 10 years and we have delivered thousands of data recoveries to our many customers over this time. We really understand the importance of providing a proper professional service to recover customers' data in an efficient and cost effective way. We are constantly investing in and improving our processes and equipment to ensure that we can have the highest recovery rates and are the first choice for all Data Recovery needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have at our disposal the highest skilled engineering expertise gained from working with leading hard drive and storage media manufacturers over many years. We have full clean room capability in our own workshops and do all the work on the drives within our own laboratories - nothing goes overseas. We work with a broad range of customers from the smallest end users to the largest IT departments and companies including many other data recovery companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While these customers' requirements maybe a little different we treat all projects with the same level of professionalism. We have been doing work for many organizations big and small who return to us time after time as they know we are professional and consistently deliver in a low key cost effective way. We adopt very strict policies and watertight procedures regarding data handling and processing and we treat all customer' information with the utmost confidentiality. We sign up to our own charter for non-disclosure and are usually happy to sign any specific customer additional agreements.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5196"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5199-4"><!-- content --><p>What do I do when I suspect a data recovery problem?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5197"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5198-4"><!-- content --><p>The best advice is stop whatever activity youâ€™re doing and don't do anything further that can likely make a bad situation worse. You should quickly note all observable facts and shut the machine down as quickly and as safely as possible. If you're in doubt call Ciel Technologies Data Recovery who will talk you through the process. We strongly suggest NOT to run off the shelf basic data recovery software as in many cases it is of poor quality and more importantly when ran on a failing drive, it can cause it to deteriorate further.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5200"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5203-4"><!-- content --><p>What is the normal turnaround time?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5201"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5202-4"><!-- content --><p>Typically, this depends on the root cause of the issue that is with the drive under examination. We aim to have all evaluations done within the first 8 hours of receipt with the full data recoveries ranging from 24 hours to rarely more than 5 days from the time we receive the customer approval to proceed. We have automated many of the processes which speed up the turnaround time and we have projects running in our laboratory 24 hours per day 7 days per week.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5234"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5235-4"><!-- content --><p>Do you employ a confidentiality policy? Is my data safe with you?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5236"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5245-4"><!-- content --><p>Yes, absolutely, this is something we constantly review and put significant emphasis on in our process. All our staff are strongly vetted and sign up to our charter of total client confidentiality. Virtually all the data we recover is personal and /or company confidential and must be always handled very carefully. We carry out work for staff and departments of Banks, Health Services Executives to name but a few. We are bound by the confidentiality clause in the Non-Disclosure Agreement which can be downloaded or we are usually happy to review and sign customer specific agreements. All recovered data is encrypted (using true crypt) before transportation if not collected by the customer in person.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5248"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5251-4"><!-- content --><p>Can you guarantee to recover my data?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5249"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5259-7"><!-- content --><p>In short no! Without seeing your drive and evaluating it we cannot say but no data recovery company can guarantee to recover your data as this does depend on what is actually wrong with your media in the first place. However, we are confident that no matter what the problem is we have likely seen it or similar before and if there is the remotest chance of recovering data we can do it. We are confident as using our advanced proprietary data recovery tools and processes, as well as our Class-100 clean room facility we regularly recover data from drives that others including</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>several data recovery companies have pronounced unrecoverable. Many other data recovery companies send data recovery work to us that they were unable to recover. We are very confident we can successfully recover data from many instances where other recovery companies fail but of course it is always easier, simpler and less expensive the less work that's done on the drive after the failure.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5262"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5263-4"><!-- content --><p>Someone else has looked at this and said the drive is damaged. How possible is data recovery?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5264"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5273-7"><!-- content --><p>We are experts in data loss recovery. We will do everything possible to recover your valuable data as we are well recognized as the leading data recovery experts. Even if you think (or are told by an expert) that your data is lost without trace we can in many cases still recover that data using our smart specialist data recovery tools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It should be mentioned and worth noting though that we have found the data recovery process to be in most cases much easier, simpler and of course cheaper if we can receive the drive in its &quot;as failed condition&quot;. We find that in many cases the secondary damage caused through inexperienced investigation after the initial fault can add more complications than the original failure! We also recommend that you do not use cheap data recovery software as much of this does nothing and can reduce the chance of a successful recovery.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5276"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5279-4"><!-- content --><p>What types of media do you work with?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5277"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5287-8"><!-- content --><p>We work with virtually any type of media, but we see the majority of our recoveries still come from desktop, laptop and external hard drives. These drives fall into four main interface types IDE, SCSI, SATA and SAS which are usually single drives within the machine but we also see drives configured in RAID arrays used in servers and large capacity desktop machines.</p><p id="u5287-4">In recent times we are seeing much more of the data recovery requirements for the data stored on portable media such as USB Memory sticks as well as solid state drives (SSD), camera cards (SD/XO) and compact cards and digital recorders. We have developed, many new techniques and tools that allow us recover data from these types of storage media and hold a number of key patents on this equipment.</p><p id="u5287-6">We also provide full recovery services for data stored on DLT and DAT Tapes, Floppy Disks (3.5&quot;, 5.25&quot;), Magneto optical disks, Zip disks as well as providing data conversion from many other media types.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5290"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5291-4"><!-- content --><p>What Operating System platforms do you work with?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5292"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5301-4"><!-- content --><p>We can recover data from virtually any Operating system including DOS, Windows (3.x, 95, 98, 2000, Me, XP), NT, Novell, Unix, Macintosh and other proprietary systems found in some Digital Camera systems. We have experience and familiarity with NT, FAT, UFS+, XFS, HFS, XT2, XT3 as well as other proprietary ones found in some digital video recorders.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5304"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5305-4"><!-- content --><p>Do you have a clean room and is one necessary for a data recovery job?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5306"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5315-4"><!-- content --><p>We have of course a fully environmentally (Class 100) controlled clean room laboratory enabling us to carry out the most intricate data recovery work to the highest standards. This laboratory is constantly monitored and is properly maintained and calibrated. This facility is available as handling and opening of the drives can only be done safely in a clean room environment to increase the chances of recovery. While not all data recovery situations require the use of the full features of the clean room it is very important that the patient drives are handled properly and carefully and that no further deterioration occurs to them while undergoing analysis.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5318"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5319-4"><!-- content --><p>Will all of my files be recovered?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5320"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5329-4"><!-- content --><p>The majority of our data recovery cases result in a full recovery and all files are recovered. In certain cases if there are damaged sectors on the drive certain files may not be retrievable from these sectors. This is why we provide a file listing and an error log to show all the files that are recoverable as well as any that are damaged so that you can be sure all the important data needed is recoverable before you proceed.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5332"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5335-4"><!-- content --><p>Will the old file names be intact?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5333"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5343-4"><!-- content --><p>In most cases filenames will be intact as they were when you last saved them. However, in a small percentage of cases recovered files may not have the original filename and will be recovered by file type (e.g. MS Excel) with a generic name.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5346"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5347-4"><!-- content --><p>Are there tricks that I can do myself that could work to facilitate a recovery?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5348"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5357-4"><!-- content --><p>In short, no! In our experience DIY recovery is not possible and in fact most cause significant further damage to the chances of a full successful recovery. When data recovery is required it is usually because an issue has occurred with the storage media; careful examination&nbsp; of the problem is always best before embarking on any recovery option. If your data is important to you we would always recommend that you do not take risks and we suggest that you please contact us to hear how we can help instead!</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5360"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5363-4"><!-- content --><p>How much does data recovery cost?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5361"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5371-13"><!-- content --><p>This depends solely on the problem there is with the media. The first and most important thing we do is to properly evaluate the drive in the laboratory to comprehensively identify the root cause of the problem with the drive while also outlining the recommended corrective action needed including the exact materials and time needed to recover it. The information you will receive will be clear, unambiguous and accurate. This evaluation stage is really the most crucial stage of the recovery and needs to be carried out competently. We make available all of our advanced tools to&nbsp; carry out this evaluation fully and comprehensively to get a full and accurate picture of what is wrong as well as the most cost effective way to rectify it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once we have completed the initial evaluation, we will be in a position to give you a full and comprehensive breakdown of the exact problems on the drive, what needs to be done including the details of each stage of the process. We will report the exact costs and of course we will seek your full approval before progressing any further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do have an initial small evaluation fee which covers some of the costs associated with carrying out the full and comprehensive evaluation of the suspect drive. Our prices are totally open and transparent and are always fair and reasonable and there are no hidden costs or nasty surprises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have automated many aspects of the basic process and with the high utilization of our equipment we have much reduced direct labour allowing us to complete recovery in many cases at a significantly lower total cost in comparison to our competitors.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5374"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5375-4"><!-- content --><p>Is there a diagnostic fee?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5376"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5385-6"><!-- content --><p>We believe that this initial diagnostic (what we term evaluation) is the most critical stage of the data recovery process and since we employ the best processes, equipment and expertise in the business we find that our customers are more than happy to pay a small fee to get the proper advice and the real facts.</p><p id="u5385-4">This fee of course is also fully redeemable against any further charges that may occur if the customer opts to proceed with the recommended work and would be refundable if the drive was found to unrecoverable due to a limitation in our process. We are confident that we are the best in the business and by utilizing our services the probability of a successful and cost effective recovery is the highest in the industry.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5388"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5389-4"><!-- content --><p>I only need a few critical files is there a different price just for them?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5390"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5399-4"><!-- content --><p>The answer is generally not! The reason being that the process of data recovery is not so much about the actual data that is on the drive, but the difficulty in getting the data off the drive. In some case however a limited recovery might only be possible (what's termed partial recovery) and in this case then prices would be discounted versus a total recovery.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5402"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5403-4"><!-- content --><p>I see there are a couple of companies who have a fixed charge and also no fix no fee can you match this?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5404"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5413-4"><!-- content --><p>The answer is we can do better than this! These companies are charging what may seem like an attractive price to get the job in hoping that it if it is a simple or easy recovery they can do it. The problem is that if the recovery is anything above what a competent IT engineer would be able to do, many data recovery companies are unable to deliver and worse still can add a lot of extra complications to a relatively simple recovery. Damaged drives can deteriorate fast and so a proper competent initial evaluation is vital. The reality is there is nothing for nothing and anybody who suggests no fix no fee on data recovery is simply gambling with your data.</p></div></div></li>
     <li class="AccordionPanel clearfix colelem" id="u5416"><!-- vertical box --><div class="AccordionPanelTab clearfix colelem" id="u5417-4"><!-- content --><p>If you cannot recover my files is there a charge?</p></div><div class="AccordionPanelContent disn clearfix colelem" id="u5418"><!-- group --><div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u5427-4"><!-- content --><p>We very proud of our high success rate and it is not often that we find that we cannot recover the data for our clients. If the worse should happen and the data is deemed unrecoverable due to shortcomings in our process we will refund the initial evaluation fee charge in full, along with your media device and there will be no additional charges for re-assembly or parts used for the initial evaluation we have performed.</p></div></div></li>

In many cases the data will fit on a CD or DVD and in some cases customers require a memory stick or if it's a lot of data we generally put the data onto an external portable hard drive. We will encrypt all the data before sending it back to you.</p></div></div></li>

It is advisable that you contact Ciel Technologies Data Recovery specialists immediately. In our considerable experience we have found the data recovery process to be in most cases much easier, simpler and of course cheaper if we can receive the drive in its &quot;as failed condition&quot;.</p></div></div></li>

Many reasons may cause the heads to contact the data surface in a non-normal way such as heat, vibration, power fluctuation etc. Once a crash occurs, and the damage is inflicted on the surface of the platters, more serious damage begins to present itself. The damage is usually compounded each time the heads traverse the damaged area. Occasionally, the damage will be to the heads causing no damage to the surface of the platters. In these cases, the damage will often sound like a clicking noise or worse a whirring/grinding noise. The longer a hard drive runs after the initial crash; the more likely data will not be recoverable.</p></div></div></li>

The success of the recovery in this case depends on the usage from when the files were deleted and the available capacity of the drive. Writing new data generally reduces the probability of recovering all files but if the drive is very big and the overwrite is small the percentage lost can be small. Again, we recommend that you do not use cheap data recovery software as much of this does nothing BUT can reduce the chance of a successful recovery.</p></div></div></li>

We have found that while RAID's are designed for redundancy, when a failure occurs the rebuild process may not always happen properly and it appears like all the data is lost and a backup has not run correctly or has failed for a long time. In many cases the RAID recovery and reconstruction itself can be relatively straightforward and in most cases is fully recoverable. It is very unlikely that two drives fail together and while it may appear like so, a calm and cool proper evaluation can usually result in a full and proper recovery of these arrays. If, however there is genuine multi hard drive failure, then the normal hard ware data recovery process will need to be used in addition to the RAID Reconstruction but again the recovery rates are very high.</p></div></div></li>

In many cases, the actual recovery process is to some extent independent of the data type stored on the Server but nevertheless we have very significant experience recovering from damage to Servers running heavy duty database based systems across multiple drives. The more typical recoveries we have seen are MS Exchange Server, Windows SBE as well as Oracle, My SQL Databases, MS access etc. running on Windows or Unix.</p></div></div></li>
